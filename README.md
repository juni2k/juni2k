### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like computers, music and visual arts! Most of my projects live at https://git.sr.ht/~juni/ these days.

#### Here's what I did in the past:

- [shaker](https://git.sr.ht/~juni/shaker): an experimental visualizer for Winamp.
- [libmoor](https://github.com/juni2k/libmoor): libraries and tools for extracting assets out of [Moorhuhn.](https://archive.org/details/Moorhuhnjagd_1020)
- [juniscrobble](https://git.sr.ht/~juni/juniscrobble): a Last.fm scrobbler for Winamp.
