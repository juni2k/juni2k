### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like computers, music and visual arts! Most of my projects live at https://git.sr.ht/~juni/ these days.

#### Here's what I did in the past:

- [shaker](https://git.sr.ht/~juni/shaker): an experimental visualizer for Winamp.
- [libmoor](https://git.sr.ht/~juni/libmoor): libraries and tools for extracting assets out of [Moorhuhn.](https://archive.org/details/Moorhuhnjagd_1020)
- [juniscrobble](https://git.sr.ht/~juni/juniscrobble): a Last.fm scrobbler for Winamp.
- [mp3dir](https://github.com/juni2k/mp3dir): creates a lossy copy of your music library.
- [hvv](https://github.com/juni2k/hvv): navigate the seedy underworld of Hamburg from the terminal.
- [autopilot](https://github.com/juni2k/autopilot): migrate off GitHub with ease.
- [scripts](https://github.com/juni2k/scripts): cursed Perl code for your Unix workstation.
